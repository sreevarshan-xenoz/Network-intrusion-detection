# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves building a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning to classify network traffic and detect malicious activities in real-time. The system will act as an automated security guard, identifying various types of cyber attacks including DDoS, port scans, brute force attacks, and other suspicious network behaviors before they can compromise system security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network security administrator, I want the system to classify network traffic as normal or malicious, so that I can quickly identify and respond to potential security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic data is input to the system THEN the system SHALL classify it as either "normal" or "malicious" with at least 95% accuracy
2. WHEN the system processes network packets THEN it SHALL return classification results within 100ms for real-time detection
3. WHEN malicious traffic is detected THEN the system SHALL provide a confidence score between 0-1 for the classification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to identify specific types of attacks, so that I can understand the nature of threats and respond appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malicious traffic is detected THEN the system SHALL classify it into specific attack categories (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R)
2. WHEN an attack is classified THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% precision for each attack type
3. WHEN multiple attack types are present THEN the system SHALL correctly identify all present attack types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the system to process various network datasets, so that it can learn from diverse traffic patterns and attack signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NSL-KDD dataset is provided THEN the system SHALL successfully load and preprocess the data
2. WHEN CICIDS2017/2018 datasets are provided THEN the system SHALL handle the larger dataset size and extract relevant features
3. WHEN new datasets are introduced THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and handle different feature schemas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to preprocess network data effectively, so that machine learning models can achieve optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorical features are present THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate encoding (label encoding or one-hot encoding)
2. WHEN numerical features have different scales THEN the system SHALL normalize them using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
3. WHEN duplicate or irrelevant features are detected THEN the system SHALL remove them automatically
4. WHEN class imbalance is present THEN the system SHALL apply balancing techniques like SMOTE

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to compare multiple ML models, so that I can select the best performing algorithm for intrusion detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model training is initiated THEN the system SHALL train and evaluate at least 4 different algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Neural Network)
2. WHEN models are evaluated THEN the system SHALL use appropriate metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) rather than just accuracy
3. WHEN model comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically select the best performing model based on F1-score

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security operations center analyst, I want real-time intrusion detection capabilities, so that I can respond to threats as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide a REST API endpoint for real-time traffic classification
2. WHEN network packets are captured THEN the system SHALL integrate with packet sniffing tools like Scapy
3. WHEN threats are detected in real-time THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts through configurable channels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security manager, I want detailed reporting and visualization of detected threats, so that I can understand attack patterns and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN intrusions are detected THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports with attack types, timestamps, and confidence scores
2. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide confusion matrices and ROC curves
3. WHEN feature analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL show feature importance using SHAP values or similar techniques

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the detection system to be deployable and maintainable, so that it can operate reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is packaged THEN it SHALL be containerized using Docker for easy deployment
2. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints and logging capabilities
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL support automated retraining with new data
